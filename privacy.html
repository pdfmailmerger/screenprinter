      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Personally identifiable information is never collected.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use GitHub for server hosting and distribute our applications via Apple's App Store.
      </p>

      <h2>What information do we collect and how do we use it?</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us via the support email. We use this information to reply to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not use or collect your precise geographic location.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may keep data indefinitely. We try to follow good practices for log rotation, but we also make gratuitous backups, which may inadvertently store data.
      </p>

      <h2>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.
      </p>

      <h2>Third party links</h2>
      <p>
        Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include links to third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Consent</h2>
      <p>
        By using our site, you consent to our privacy policy.
